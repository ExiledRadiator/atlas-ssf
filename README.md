# atlas-ssf
A simple Atlas progress tracking tool for Path of Exile.  Tracks the maps you currently have, maps you've completed, and maps you've done the bonus objective for.

### Manual Tracking
Just keep track of your maps and completion status manually, no need to provide any additional information.  The website will remember which boxes you have checked.

### Automatic Tracking
atlas-ssf has the capability to look for maps in characters' inventories and stashes, and use what it finds to automatically update your "Have" list.  Unfortunately, the tab you really want this to work with (that premium Maps tab you bought) doesn't currently provide any information about its contents.  Please note that using this functionality will overwrite any manual tracking of maps that you've done.  It also cannot update your Atlas completion status.
