    <h2>What is a Session Id?</h2>
    <p>
      A session ID is a unique, randomly-generated string of numbers and letters
      given to you by a website after you log in. The website uses this Session
      ID in place of your username and password to authenticate you while you're
      logged in. Once you log out, the current Session Id is destroyed and no
      longer valid.
    </p>

    <h2>Is it safe to give out my Session Id?</h2>
    <p>
      In general, <b>no</b>. If you were to post your POESESSID (what
      pathofexile.com calls their Session Id) on a forum somewhere, anyone with
      sufficient technical skill who sees it can impersonate you on
      pathofexile.com, without having to enter or know your password. They could
      do things like post messages on the official forums or spend any Points
      sitting in your account. This would be possible until you logged out of
      your account on pathofexile.com, invalidating that POESESSID.
    </p>

    <h2>So why are you asking for my POESESSID?</h2>
    <p>
      Your characters' inventories and any non-public Stash tabs are private and
      specific to your account. GGG doesn't provide that information publicly,
      and requires you to log into your account to view it. This website uses
      your POESESSID to obtain this private information, specifically:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>List of characters in your account</li>
      <li>Items equipped on your characters or in their inventories</li>
      <li>Contents of any stash tabs</li>
    </ul>

    Your POESESSID and account name are sent to a proxy server over HTTPS. This
    step is necessary because GGG has not enabled
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"
      >Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a
    >, meaning this website cannot directly request information from
    pathofexile.com. The proxy server uses your account name and POESESSID to
    request the information above, and sends it back to this website for display
    (again over HTTPS).

    <p>
      This website utilizes your browser's local storage to remember information
      after you navigate away from the page or close your browser, including
      your POESESSID and account name.
    </p>

    <h2>I'm uncomfortable!</h2>
    <p>
      No problem. You only need to provide your POESESSID if you want to
      automatically update the maps you have based on what's in your inventory
      or stashes. You can just manually keep track.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I find my POESESSID?</h2>
    <p>
      The process varies slightly between browsers, but always starts by going
      to <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com">pathofexile.com</a> and logging
      in. Once logged in, open the Developer console and look at your cookies.
      As part of the log in process, pathofexile.com will have set a cookie
      called "POESESSID". Copy that cookie's value and put it in the box on this
      website. Remember, don't publicly share this information. And if you ever
      want to revoke or invalidate it, all you have to do is log out of
      pathofexile.com.
